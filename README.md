# Problem Statement:
<p>Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from
being obtained through false pretenses. Fraud detection is applied to many industries
such as banking or insurance. In banking, fraud may include forging checks or using
stolen credit cards. Other forms of fraud may involve exaggerating losses or causing an
accident with the sole intent for the pay-out. With an unlimited and rising number of
ways someone can commit fraud, detection can be difficult to accomplish. Fraud
detection is a critical issue for retailers determined to prevent losses and preserve
customer trust.</p>
<p>Digitalization is one of the major advancements we have in this time. The global market
is at the fingertip of each and every individual through Online purchase. Both for the
consumers and sellers, online market tends to give more in terms of profit as well as
exposure to a larger community.</p>
<p>With the increase in digitalization, there is also increase in the fraudulent activities
happening in various domains, mainly in the retail domain. These are detrimental to the
ecosystem of online transactions. Machine learning provides an intelligent option in
dealing with this challenge.</p>
